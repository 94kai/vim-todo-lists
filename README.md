# vim-todo-lists

Vim plugin for TODO lists creation and management.

## Motivation

Create a simple in-editor tool for handling TODO lists that will have the
following features:

* Easy create/updated/delete operations on TODO items
* Easy navigation between TODO items
* Easy TODO lists management (e.g. create new list and archive an old one)
